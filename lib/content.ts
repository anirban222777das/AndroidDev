      "Just a student who fell in love with the endless possibilities of Android development. I get a huge kick out of seeing my code run on a physical device for the first time. Right now, I'm spending most of my time learning the ins and outs of Kotlin, getting creative with Jetpack Compose, and probably fixing a bug I created five minutes ago. It's a journey, and I'm enjoying every step.",
